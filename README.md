# My Personal Project: MacroTrack

## Macro tracking application

### What can this application do?
This application will allow users to track their macros. Key features of this project will be the ability to keep a 
record of what one has consumed, track the calories, proteins, sugars, fats, amongst other things, and enable the users to set 
macro goals. 

### Who will use this application? 
Expected user base would be people who want to take weight loss or weight gain seriously. 

### Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest to me as I struggle with weight loss, and I want to create a way to easily record and track your macros, 
seeing a history of how I've been doing as that can provide motivation to continue on your weight loss/gain journey.
